Game Pitches - Jordan Miron


## "Chet Pootrousers and the Alien Menace"

### Technical Hurdles
    * jumping ability
    * spaceship collision
    * cutscenes...?

Block-breaking game with a brain instead of a ball, and instead of bricks, human faces who can swallow the brain and then explode, after which a new brain is spawned from the mouth of a different face.

### Genre
Breakout-style game.

### Technical Hurdles
    * art assets
    * animation
    * multiple head types
    * bouncing off walls


## "Escape from Puppy Mountain"

### Genre
Flip-screen platformer, similar to Pitfall.

### Technical Hurdles
    * jumping
    * multiple screens
    * sound...?
    * moving platforms

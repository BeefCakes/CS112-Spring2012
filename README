Name: Jordan Miron

I have very little programming experience. I've done a bit of experimenting with ActionScript while working with Flash, but other than I'm pretty much a clean slate.

I'm hoping to become at least somewhat proficient in Python, and develop a greater appreciation for the game programming process. If I can go more than a month without getting overwhelmed and throwing my laptop at something, I'll consider that a success.

Setting Up Git/Github
---------------------------

Make sure to follow the instructions to [setup git/github.com](https://github.com/HampshireCS/CS112-Spring2012/wiki/Instructions).  Once you have setup git and your own fork of the course repository, simply modify the README file in the root directory with the following:

 * Name
 * Programming Background
 * What you hope to get from the course

Then, [turnin](https://github.com/HampshireCS/CS112-Spring2012/wiki/Instructions-Turnin) the homework.



Name: Jordan Miron

I have very little programming experience. I've done a bit of experimenting with ActionScript while working with Flash, but other than I'm pretty much a clean slate.

I'm hoping to become at least somewhat proficient in Python, and develop a greater appreciation for the game programming process. If I can go more than a month without getting overwhelmed and throwing my laptop at something, I'll consider that a success.

# Distance formula
#   calculate a function called "distance" to calculate the distance between two points.
#   http://www.purplemath.com/modules/distform.htm
#   ex: 
#      >>> distance((0,0), (3,4))
#      5

# def distance(a, b):

def distance(a, b):
    x1,y1 = a #splits a into two variables
    x2,y2 = b #splits b into two variables
    d = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2) #distance formula
    return d

print "distance between (4,2) and (2,4):",
print distance ((4,2), (2,4))

# Normalizing Vectors
#   normalize a vector of length N.  If given all zeros, just spit back the same vector
#   http://www.fundza.com/vectors/normalize/index.html

#   ex:
#     >>> normalize((1,1))
#     [0.70710678118654746, 0.70710678118654746]
#     >>> normalize([0,0,0])
#     [0,0,0]
#     >>> normalize([1,1,1,1])
#     [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]
